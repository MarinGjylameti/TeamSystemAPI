Application Overview
  
Create a .NET Core Web API application that uses Entity Framework (code first) and SQL Server database for the situation below:

The application should do the following:
 
	Build an endpoint that returns the list of students that are currently following a given course.

	Build an endpoint that deletes a student.
	Consider doing data validation for the endpoints.
